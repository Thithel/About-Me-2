                <p>An ode to my love of music and gaming:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 45px;"><i>Pixels dance on screens,<br>

            <h2>My personal interests:</h2>
            <p>I have always been a huge nerd. I blame my upbringing, as my dad taught me to build computers and got me addicted to video games when I was young.
                As a result, although I desparately fought off becoming a CS major and tried to figure out a different career path for the last ten years, I was
                finally defeated and turned to doing what I'm good at; sitting in front of a computer and typing. I always loved anything to do with computers,
                so I guess it's no real surprise that coding is what everntually pulled me in.
            </p>
            <p>Besides being a nerd, my other passion in life is music. I play 6 instruments at concert level. Playing music has brought me all over the world,
                from the west coast, to the south, to New York, to other countries, and more. As my most accomplished instrument was as a jazz drummer, I have
                also played with some of the most talented jazz musicians in the world including Victor Wooten, Miles Mosley, Tim Davies, and Immanuel Wilkins.
                My senior year of high school was a blast, as I only had one "real" class and 6 music classes.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from these two greatest interests in my life, everything else I do is focused around the people I love. My wife, my dogs, my family, and my
                closest friends. I love to pick up hobbies as well. Cooking, hiking, snowboarding, running, and anything that will get me out of the house or help
                keep me interested throughout the day. I wouldn't say I'm necessarily great at any of these things, but I don't think you need to be great at
                something as long as you enjoy doing it.
            </p>
